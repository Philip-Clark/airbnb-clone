Congratulations on your decision to book a vacation in sunny Maui, Hawaii; the #1 island in the world for over 25 years.  :)

I would be honored to help you choose accommodations in Maui that fit your needs, desires, and budget. 

As a full-time resident on Maui for over 15 years, I am very familiar with all that this wonderful Island has to offer.  I absolutely love my job as both an owner and property manager of vacation rentals on Maui.  The fact that I get to help others plan their Hawaiian vacation and/or relocation to the magical island of Maui is literally the icing on top of the cupcake!

If you are wanting to purchase property on Maui, I am a licensed realtor in the State of Hawai'i, own a property management company in Maui, and am also a certified Home Staging Expert.  I would love to speak with you and answer any questions you might have about vacation rentals on Maui.

In addition to managing lots of amazing properties directly across the street from the awesome, sun kissed beaches of south Maui, I am also the proud owner of my own vacation rentals.   The condos I own are called Tracy’s Tropical Treasures.  They are listed on Airbnb as Tracy's Tropical Treasure #1 (Ocean View), Tracy's Tropical Treasure #2 (Corner Penthouse), Tracy's Tropical Treasure #3 (Ocean View), and my newest addition, Paradise Awaits You! Tracy's Tropical Treasure #4 (Ocean View, Central A.C., and double pane windows, so no road noise inside the condo).  *Tracy’s Tropical Treasure #3 and Paradise Awaits You! Tracy's Tropical Treasure #4 both house up to 4 guests.  :)

Tracy’s Tropical Treasures were Named the #1 Vacation Rentals in all of Maui in 2016.

In November, 2019, I was RANKED #1 again.  ;)

In July of 2022, I was ranked #1 in Kihei for the fourth time.

I have worked very hard for these achievements and on every single occasion, it was one of the best days of my life when I received confirmation that I had won the award.  

I look forward to speaking with you, helping you with your Maui vacation/relocation, and sharing my ALOHA spirit.  I have been in the hospitality industry for over 25 years, and it's really how I choose to live my life.  Pampering guests is my #1 priority!  

* With well over 1000 bookings on the 4 rentals I personally own, I am extremely proud and take great pride in the fact that I have so many wonderful reviews.  Please feel free to check out all the reviews on Airbnb for the proof.   Customer Service is very important to me!

I am also very proud that I have been with Airbnb since 2009 and have also been a ""SUPERHOST” since the program was created.  In July of 2022, I earned Superhost status for the 33rd consecutive time.  

Airbnb is, without a doubt, the BEST vacation rental platform of all!  

When Airbnb was first created, I was one of only eight listings in all of Maui.  My claim to fame is that Brian Chesky, himself, actually called me.  Brian is one of the three Airbnb founders.  Back then, I had also listed my car on Airbnb, and Brian said I was the first person to ever list a car on his platform.  He thought it was interesting, and we had a very nice telephone conversation.

By the end of 2020, Maui had over 18,000 vacation rental listings.  The Airbnb platform has grown exponentially.  I am truly honored to be a part of it all; both as an owner and as a property manager and will continue to tell everyone how wonderful Airbnb is for hosts and travelers alike.

Everybody, no matter where they are, can live ALOHA.  Maui is a great way to unlock the positive spirit within all of us.....

Make it a great day!

The surf is relatively calm and great for a morning workout.  Afterwards I like to go to Nola's for breakfast.  In the afternoon you'll likely find me at Coconuts for their great fish tacos and at Mamas Fish House for dinner.

In the evening I like to walk down to 5P (5 Palms) for their happy hour specials.  The beach across the street is beautiful and I like to spend the day there before breaking out the bbq in the evening.  I like to go to the Dog and Duck Pub for a night cap and a bit of live music.

However, I keep busy managing both properties, when we're not dancing, playing softball/tennis, or at the beach.  One of the advantages of living here on Kauai and offering vacation properties for rent is that any issues with units that may arise are addressed immediately and decisively through direct communication between the guests and me, the owner. There is no go-between management company in the loop to delay any action that may be required.  It's a win-win for everyone.

I am co-founder of the Big Island Jazz and Blues Society responsible for bringing in performers like Maria Muldaur, Ray Brown Jr., or Keahi Conjugacion and Volcano Choy Jr. to our humble Hilo town.

In quiet moments I love working with my bonsai and spending my time designing my koi pond. Working with our rich Volcano soil planting organic vegetables is also an enjoyable pastime. Travel to distant lands is always exciting, my favorite spots being Iquitos on the Amazon, Machu Picchu, the Cotswolds in England and bungie jumping in New Zealand.

Saturdays find me with the wind in my face on the back of our new Ultra Classic  Harley heading for lunch at The Fish and Hog in Waimea, Aunty Kanae's for teri pork or Gramma's in Honoka'a. I love being a biker babe and we did a one-month bike tour to Sturgis and the Badlands and 6 1/2 weeks from San Diego to Washington and down the coast of Oregon and northern California to see the redwoods.  Maybe one day I can learn to ski and hope happy visitors to my House of Bonsai will successfully get me there.

We found Kihei Kai Nani to be the perfect place to buy and rent out condos for various reasons:  first and probably the most important, it is located across the street from three of the best beaches on Maui, secondly, it is located in South Kihei, which is the driest, most sunny area of the island and finally, because it is in South Kihei, it is affordable for us and our guests, yet within a short distance to luxurious Wailea.  We enjoy renting out our units to guests because they all enjoy the island and everything it has to offer, as much as we do and we get to enjoy the island ourselves.

I am 50 something and running our family owned and operated Bed and Breakfast and vacation rental. It takes a lot to manage 6 rooms and a family of 6.  I get help from my husband Dan, daughter Everley and her fiance, Cameron. We really enjoy what we do here just helping visitors enjoy Volcano and our Big Island. We live on site with our 4 dogs,  bun bun Bella, box turtle Exodus, cat Lunette and the  countless pheasant living nearby.
We have lived on Big Island since 1992 and have been running Aloha Crater Lodge since 2007. We have learned to be eco friendly along the way by hanging up sheets to dry, solar panel to help with hot water and we take out our own garbage as well as recycle and compost. 
We are involved in community, Volcano has a lot going on at our community center with a covered skate park, farmers market weekly, yoga and plenty new stuff all the time. One neighborhood church we have attended 2004, New Hope Fellowship Volcano, has been very awesome. Dan and I serve in the children's ministry, I dance hula and Dan strums the ukulele learning our favorite songs.

Congratulations on your decision to book a vacation in sunny Maui, Hawaii; the #1 island in the world for over 25 years.  :)

I would be honored to help you choose accommodations in Maui that fit your needs, desires, and budget. 

As a full-time resident on Maui for over 15 years, I am very familiar with all that this wonderful Island has to offer.  I absolutely love my job as both an owner and property manager of vacation rentals on Maui.  The fact that I get to help others plan their Hawaiian vacation and/or relocation to the magical island of Maui is literally the icing on top of the cupcake!

If you are wanting to purchase property on Maui, I am a licensed realtor in the State of Hawai'i, own a property management company in Maui, and am also a certified Home Staging Expert.  I would love to speak with you and answer any questions you might have about vacation rentals on Maui.

In addition to managing lots of amazing properties directly across the street from the awesome, sun kissed beaches of south Maui, I am also the proud owner of my own vacation rentals.   The condos I own are called Tracy’s Tropical Treasures.  They are listed on Airbnb as Tracy's Tropical Treasure #1 (Ocean View), Tracy's Tropical Treasure #2 (Corner Penthouse), Tracy's Tropical Treasure #3 (Ocean View), and my newest addition, Paradise Awaits You! Tracy's Tropical Treasure #4 (Ocean View, Central A.C., and double pane windows, so no road noise inside the condo).  *Tracy’s Tropical Treasure #3 and Paradise Awaits You! Tracy's Tropical Treasure #4 both house up to 4 guests.  :)

Tracy’s Tropical Treasures were Named the #1 Vacation Rentals in all of Maui in 2016.

In November, 2019, I was RANKED #1 again.  ;)

In July of 2022, I was ranked #1 in Kihei for the fourth time.

I have worked very hard for these achievements and on every single occasion, it was one of the best days of my life when I received confirmation that I had won the award.  

I look forward to speaking with you, helping you with your Maui vacation/relocation, and sharing my ALOHA spirit.  I have been in the hospitality industry for over 25 years, and it's really how I choose to live my life.  Pampering guests is my #1 priority!  

* With well over 1000 bookings on the 4 rentals I personally own, I am extremely proud and take great pride in the fact that I have so many wonderful reviews.  Please feel free to check out all the reviews on Airbnb for the proof.   Customer Service is very important to me!

I am also very proud that I have been with Airbnb since 2009 and have also been a ""SUPERHOST” since the program was created.  In July of 2022, I earned Superhost status for the 33rd consecutive time.  

Airbnb is, without a doubt, the BEST vacation rental platform of all!  

When Airbnb was first created, I was one of only eight listings in all of Maui.  My claim to fame is that Brian Chesky, himself, actually called me.  Brian is one of the three Airbnb founders.  Back then, I had also listed my car on Airbnb, and Brian said I was the first person to ever list a car on his platform.  He thought it was interesting, and we had a very nice telephone conversation.

By the end of 2020, Maui had over 18,000 vacation rental listings.  The Airbnb platform has grown exponentially.  I am truly honored to be a part of it all; both as an owner and as a property manager and will continue to tell everyone how wonderful Airbnb is for hosts and travelers alike.

Everybody, no matter where they are, can live ALOHA.  Maui is a great way to unlock the positive spirit within all of us.....

Make it a great day!

I live most of the year in San Francisco and escape to Maui whenever I get tired of the foggy weather. I run a small software company and have the good fortune of being able to work anywhere there's an internet connection. Luckily that's the case with Maui, so whenever I get an urge for whale watching, diving, or laying in the sun it's no problem coming over. I love diving and the diving in Maui is spectacular, there are some really beautiful spots. I also have a passion for photography, particularly whales and outdoor scenes, so you'll see some of my work on the walls of the unit.

I hope you'll check out my place. I put a lot of work into it making sure it was a livable space for when I'm there. So I think the standards I have for the condo is much higher than most rental units.

I bought this because I'll be there about two months of the year and I wanted something on the ocean. A friend of mine lives in the same building so I was very familiar with the property and all it offered (ok, so mostly it offered the ocean about 20 feet way :-).

I am Lani and I am passionate about sharing and passing on the love I have for my island Home of Kauai to those who visit this special place.

I’ve lived on Kauai for much of my life. I was born near Tunnels Beach and have always considered the North Shore of Kauai “home”. However, adventures beyond the islands, eventually brought me to the mainland and abroad.  I went to school in Santa Cruz California and even got interested in colder climates for a while. Between travels abroad, I worked as an entrepreneur and in various outdoor industries for the better part of a decade, living in amazingly scenic, rural towns. One of my favorite of those towns was Jackson Hole Wyoming, where I lived for several years before moving back to Kauai. It took searching the world to ultimately realize, there’s no place like home.  

I truly enjoy passing on the love and reverence I have of my island home to my guests. I offer my local knowledge and recommendations in addition to providing exceptional quality accommodation and service. I want to ensure that my guests have as much fun and as little worries as possible on their visits to Kauai!

I love offering conscientious  travelers an amazing home while they explore the Garden Island, and both my condos are thoughtfully equipped, well located and always kept clean and attended to with lots of love.

I am are honored to have received such great reviews, and maintained a consistent Airbnb SuperHost rating that I have held strong for several years.

I am grateful for my guests, as they give to me just as much as I give them.

I've been very blessed to enjoy traveling as a child while my dad was in the military and then as an adult for my job and with my husband.  We began visiting Hawaii in 1999 and our annual visits turned into our first purchase of a vacation home in 2006.  It was on our 4th trip to the Big Island of Hawaii and during our 2nd stay at the Keauhou Kona Surf and Racquet Club that we began looking for our own place.  The diversity of this island paradise and the wonderful snorkeling and the lovely townhouse settings made all the other complexes pale in comparison on our searches - we purchased townhouse #59 and returned for our fifth trip to completely redo the unit (tile to ceiling) in preparation for personal and guest visits.  We still feel the same way about this wonderful place and now own a second, completely oceanfront unit (#196) in this same lovely complex.  And, it's only gotten better.  Our goal in rentals is to offer what we'd want and expect in a unit if we were traveling.  Super clean, well maintained, simple and beautful decor, plenty of space to pack away our suitcases and settle in comfortably, good beds & linens, and complete kitchens for at home meals whenever we like.  Fortunately for us, many of our guests appreciate and expect the same type of accomodation and we have several guests or groups of guests that have become repeat visitors to our lovely place/s.  All have said this is the best place they've found and the first place they check for return visits.  We love and appreciate all of our guests but even more so our repeat or referred guests.  We'd be delighted to welcome you and your friends to a stay in paradise. Our motto in life - pay it forward; be the first to do the right thing; set the right example; good karma will follow you.  Our guests should know that we will do everything to help them enjoy their stay with us.  It's a point of pride for us - no cutting corners, etc...we want and expect that guests continue to say how nice they expected it to be and how much nicer it actually was.  And, if there's ever a problem; resolving it is our top priority.  We don't want our guests to worry or be inconvenieced wherever possible.
